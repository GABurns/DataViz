A collection of plots used for different purposes on social media, ranging from

<h2> Radar Plot  </h2>

I wanted to create a plot that looked like an high contrast radar display, akin to the 
alien detector from Alien. This was a quick response in relation to a blog post what type
of problem solver you are? I thought it over-simplified the issue as you can be a piece of
each category and that can change dependent on the situation and context.
