<h1 align="center"> Social Media Plots </h1>

A collection of plots used for different purposes on social media, ranging from 
a dataviz to support an organisational social media campaign to something for a 
bit of fun!

<h2> Rainfall Plot  </h2>

This plot was created for [Exploristics](https://exploristics.com/) LinkedIn Halloween
social media campaign. The long lines of the plot were meant to look like a ECG with
the dots looking like dripping blood.

<h2> Radar Plot  </h2>

I wanted to create a plot that looked like an high contrast radar display, akin to the 
alien detector from Alien. This was a quick response in relation to a blog post what type
of problem solver you are? I thought it over-simplified the issue as you can be a piece of
each category and that can change dependent on the situation and context.
